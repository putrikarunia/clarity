# Clarity

**Clarity**, an Android application designed to improve readability for dyslexic individuals, provides real-time transcription from image/text to an interactive, dyslexia-friendly format.

Users are able to take photos of text such as newspapers, street signs, or textbook readings, and Clarity will identify bodies of text that the user can choose to interact with. Similarly, users are able to copy-and-paste text into the translator and immediately generate formatted text.

With text translation, Clarity aims to provide multi-sensory associations, such as text-to-speech or color highlighting, and allows for user personalization of settings like font face, line-spacing, and highlight color. Users can also save their translations in folders to look at later (e.g. saving Shakespeare readings inside a folder titled "Literature").

With dyslexia-friendly formatting, user customization, and a heavy emphasis on ease-of-use design, Clarity seamlessly aids dyslexic people in their day-to-day lives.
